                Dr. Rose Yu is an assistant professor at the University of California San Diego, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. 
                She earned her Ph.D. in Computer Sciences at USC in 2017. She was subsequently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Caltech. Her research focuses 
                on advancing machine learning techniques for large-scale spatiotemporal data analysis, with applications to sustainability, health, and 
                physical sciences. A particular emphasis of her research is on physics-guided AI which aims to integrate first principles with 
                data-driven models. Among her awards, she has won Army ECASE Award, NSF CAREER Award, Hellman Fellow, Faculty Research Award from JP Morgan, 
                Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Adobe, Several Best Paper Awards, Best Dissertation Award at USC, and was nominated as one of the 
                'MIT Rising Stars in EECS'.

                <a href="https://cega.berkeley.edu/">Center for Effective Global Action</a>. Blumenstock does research at the intersection of 
                machine learning and empirical economics, with a focus on how novel data and technology can better address the needs of poor and 
                vulnerable people around the world. He has a Ph.D. in Information Science and a M.A. in Economics 
                from U.C. Berkeley, and Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Physics from Wesleyan University. He is a recipient of awards 
                including the NSF CAREER award, the Intel Faculty Early Career Honor, and the U.C. Berkeley Chancellor's Award for Public Service. 
                His work has appeared in general interest journals including <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature</em>, and 
                <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>,
                as well as top economics journals (e.g., the <em>American Economic Review</em>) and computer science conferences (e.g., ICML, KDD, AAAI,

    <h2 id="CFP">Call For Papers</h2>
    <p>We invite papers from the broader intersection of machine learning and societal applications. Application areas are focused on, 
        but not limited to, the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>, such as health and 
        well-being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, and climate action. Accepted papers 
        will be included as part of the workshop proceedings of KDD; however, we do provide authors the option to opt out of formal proceedings. 
        Therefore, a paper getting accepted and presented at this workshop does not preclude authors from submitting their work in other conferences
        or journals. However, the default assumption is that all camera-ready versions of the accepted papers will be uploaded to the workshop 
        website. If any author would not like to have their camera-ready versions uploaded to the this workshop website (because of some conflict 
        of interest), please reach out to the workshop chairs and we would be happy to accommodate such requests.
    </p>

    <p>Submissions to the workshop track are single-blind, i.e., author names and affiliations should be listed.</p>

    <p>We welcome two types of papers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Long Papers, which are limited to 8 pages (including references)</li>
      <li>Short Papers, which are limited to 4 pages (including references)</li>
    </ul>  

    <p>All submissions must use ACM Conference Proceeding template (two column format). 
    Additional supplemental material focused on reproducibility can be provided. Proofs, pseudo-code, and code may also be included in the supplement, 
    which has no explicit page limit. As in previous years, the supplementary material should be included in the same pdf file with the main manuscript. 
    The main body of the paper should be self-contained, since reviewers are not required to read the supplementary material. The supplementary material 
    will not be included in the proceedings.</p>
    <p>Submission must be made through Microsoft CMT (<a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DSSG2023">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DSSG2023</a>).</p>    

    <p>Submissions violating these formatting requirements will be desk-rejected. 
    The Word template guideline can be found <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">here</a>. 
    The Latex/overleaf template guideline can be found <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty">here</a>.</p>
