    <p>
        The field of data science stands at an inflection point, and there could be many different directions 
        in which the future of data science research could unfold. Accordingly, there is a growing interest to 
        ensure that current and future data science research is used in a responsible manner for the benefit of 
        humanity (i.e., for social good). To achieve this goal, a wide range of perspectives and contributions 
        are needed, spanning the full spectrum from fundamental research to sustained deployments in the real 
        world. This workshop will explore how data science research can contribute to solving challenging problems 
        faced by current-day societies. For example, what role can data science research play in promoting health, 
        sustainable development, and infrastructure security? How can data science initiatives be used to achieve 
        consensus among a set of negotiating self-interested entities (e.g., finding resolutions to trade talks 
        between countries)? To address such questions, this workshop will bring together researchers and 
        practitioners across different strands of data science research and a wide range of important real-world 
        application domains. The objective is to share the current state of research and practice, explore future 
        work directions, and create collaboration opportunities. In addition, the workshop will emphasize 
        highlighting data science approaches for tackling the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our workshop's target audience consists of 
        <ul>
            <li>(i) Data science and machine learning researchers who are using their research to solve important 
                real-world problems for society's benefit in a measurable manner;</li>
            <li>(ii) Interdisciplinary researchers combining data science research with various 
                disciplines (e.g., social sciences, natural sciences);</li>
            <li>(iii) Engineers and scientists from organizations who aim for social good, and look to build real-world 
                systems using data science techniques.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Social challenges of interest include, but are not limited to, public health, environmental sustainability and 
        conservation, and human rights. Please see the <a href="#CFP">Call for Papers</a> for more details.

    <h2 id="CFP">Call For Papers</h2>
    <p>We invite papers from the broader intersection of machine learning and societal applications. Application areas are focused on, 
        but not limited to, the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>, such as health and 
        well-being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, and climate action. Accepted papers 
        will be included as part of the workshop proceedings of KDD; however, we do provide authors the option to opt out of formal proceedings. 
        Therefore, a paper getting accepted and presented at this workshop does not preclude authors from submitting their work in other conferences
        or journals. However, the default assumption is that all camera-ready versions of the accepted papers will be uploaded to the workshop 
        website. If any author would not like to have their camera-ready versions uploaded to the this workshop website (because of some conflict 
        of interest), please reach out to the workshop chairs and we would be happy to accommodate such requests.
    </p>

    <p>Submissions to the workshop track are single-blind, i.e., author names and affiliations should be listed.</p>

    <p>We welcome two types of papers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Long Papers, which are limited to 8 pages (including references)</li>
      <li>Short Papers, which are limited to 4 pages (including references)</li>
    </ul>  

    <p>All submissions must use ACM Conference Proceeding template (two column format). 
    Additional supplemental material focused on reproducibility can be provided. Proofs, pseudo-code, and code may also be included in the supplement, 
    which has no explicit page limit. As in previous years, the supplementary material should be included in the same pdf file with the main manuscript. 
    The main body of the paper should be self-contained, since reviewers are not required to read the supplementary material. The supplementary material 
    will not be included in the proceedings.</p>
    <p>Submission must be made through Microsoft CMT (<a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DSSG2023">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DSSG2023</a>).</p>    

    <p>Submissions violating these formatting requirements will be desk-rejected. 
    The Word template guideline can be found <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">here</a>. 
    The Latex/overleaf template guideline can be found <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty">here</a>.</p>
